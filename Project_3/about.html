          <h1 class="page-title"> About Me </h1>
          <p> Hello Folks! I am Aniket. The degree on my bathroom wall says that I am a Computer Engineer, but as the home page says, I am also a developer and a huge tech geek!</p>
          <p>I like to play around with Technology. May that be a shiny new HTC Vive or a good ol' rusty Virtual Boy. When it comes to work, I like to make windows apps, web apps and model machine learning solutions. I love working in teams. Solving complex problems together with a bunch of people from differet backgrounds is my adrenaline rush!
          Above all I love to provide an awesome solution to my customers without ripping the off! For some of my previous work with different clients, do check my portfolio!</p>

          <p> Career Goals are tricky for me. I hate setting expectations. They can be a double edged swords! That being said, heres a generic blueprint of my career goals</p>
          <p>Step 1: Kick off the tech life in an awesome main-stream tech company.<br> Step 2: Learn as much as you can until you get bored of the team.<br> Step 3: Switch teams and repeat step 2 until you finally get to the stage that you say "Lets get outta this hell hole"<br> Step 4: Leave the company, join a startup, do actual work and enjoy!<br> Note: These may change on daily basis</p>

          <h1 class="page-title"> Life Goals </h1>
          <p> Life goals ain't tricky. Its just that they may alter as life goes by. I just hope some of the "Dreams I had as a kid" are still alive by the time I have enough to fulfill them.</p>
          <p>One goal that has stayed with me till date is travelling! I want to explore the world. Meet people from different backgrounds, experience different cultures and integrate all the learnings into myself.<br> More recently I have started to have this feeling that I want to earn crap loads of $ and give away most of it. So I'll add it here before I get greedy.<br> One more is to have a huge vinyl collections (vinyl = Music you can touch! What more do you really need in life more than that?)<br> I am gonna stop here, Im tired of typing :)</p>
